# bit-stream-error-detection-testing-project-with-JAVA
This project is a part of the course ITCS323_Computer Data Communication. this project is written in java with the aim to visualize the effectiveness of each error detection method applied on bit stream. 

The methods of detecting error are 2- dimensional even parity bit checking, checksum, CRC and hamming code
